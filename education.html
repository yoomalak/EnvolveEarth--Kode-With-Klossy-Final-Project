  <h2 class = "hTwo"> What is climate change? </h2> 
   <p2 class = "pTwo"> As according to the UN, climate change is the shift in temperature and weather across the Earth. Even though the Earth is constantly changing, along with its climate, one thing is certain -- human behavior, such as the burning of fossil fuels, is accelerating this process. </p2>

  <h3 class = "hThree"> What does climate change mean for us? </h3>
   <p3 class = "pThree"> Climate change isn't only a threat to animals, but to humans too. With climate change comes the risk of losing vital species, the melting of ice caps, depletion of the ozone layer, and severe droughts across the world. For humans, this will lead to a number of health side effects, such as: starvation, increased risk/cases of melanoma, bacterial diseases, and heat-related illness. With lax climate policy, and careless corporations, these side-effects can become both overwhelming and scary. But just as climate catastrophe can be detrimental for one's mental health --- eco-anxiety can be too. </p3>

  <h4 class = "hFour"> What is eco-anxiety? And how do I help it? </h4>
  <p class = "pFour"> Eco-anxiety can appear in one, or both of these two ways.
    1. You may feel constant anxiety regarding climate change and its effects -- constantly worrying about the state of the Earth and ecological disaster.
    OR
    2. You may feel extreme guilt about your own carbon-footprint. Worrying that you, as an individual aren't doing enough to combat climate change or that your efforts are helpless.
  If either of these sound like you, just know that your feelings are understandable, and common. Remember that climate change is not the result of ONE individual's actions, and that any action is better than none. Give yourself grace, it is impossible to live sustainabily 100% of the time, but by implementing small changes and celebraring our eco-friendly choices, we can not only relieve eco-anxiety, but we can also make space for a cleaner and greener Earth.

  <h1 class = "hSix"> What is sustainability? </h1>
   <p7 class = "sust"> Sustainability is the balance of economic development and social development, while maintaining positive interactions with the planet. Sustainability can be integrated into several aspects of development and everyday life, from urban planning, to energy sources, and even the way we eat! Sustainability can mean different things for everyone, and it's important to be forgiving towards yourself and understand that although there are many ways to integrate sustainability into your life, not all are financially viable or applicable to the community you live in.
